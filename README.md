Token-Oriented Object Notation (TOON) for .NET.

Token-Oriented Object Notation is a compact, human-readable format designed for passing structured data to Large Language Models with significantly reduced token usage.

In other words, if YAML and CSV had a baby, optimized for LLM contexts. TOON borrows YAML's indentation-based structure for nested objects and CSV's tabular format for uniform data rows, then optimizes both for token efficiency in LLM contexts.
